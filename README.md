# What is Hacktoberfest?

Every October, Digital Ocean runs Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open-sourced software. Encouraging developers at all stages in their careers to participate in the open-source community. The event is open to everyone in the global community, no matter your skill level or background and it grows in size every year.

# Zero To Mastery Hacktoberfest Projects

This event is a super popular event throughout the Zero To Mastery community, with over 400 pull requests made to the [three projects](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-42) available last year. Let's smash that record this year with our massive ZTM family!

**Following their success, we are excited to announce 3 projects for this year's Hacktoberfest:**

#### [![Animation Nation](https://img.shields.io/badge/CREATIVE%20CSS%20PROJECT-Animation%20Nation-4E3188?style=for-the-badge&logo=CSS3)](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/animation-nation)

Your favourite annual creative challenge for Hacktoberfest is here! We will once again be showcasing the creative talents of our ZTM students, this time using CSS animations.

#### PROJECT INTRODUCTION

> Using only HTML and CSS, your mission is to create a work of art with CSS. It can be as simple or elaborate as you like, however please ensure that the **code is your own**, and not copied from other sources.

Introducing a brand new project to this year's ZTM's Hacktoberfest lineup:

#### PROJECT INTRODUCTION

This project is designed with simplicity in mind, serving as a versatile, language-agnostic backend template that welcomes developers of all skill levels, whether you're a beginner looking to learn the ropes of backend development in your chosen language or a seasoned pro looking for an interesting challenge. 

Everyone is highly encouraged to participate in this project, regardless of your knowledge. After all, practice makes us all better developers!

#### [![ASCII ART](https://img.shields.io/badge/PYTHON%20PROJECT-ASCII%20ART-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=Python)](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/ascii-art)

Welcome to this year's Python challenge for Hacktoberfest, a project with beginners and aspiring developers in mind, utilizing Python to convert images into ASCII Art.

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation. It consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable characters, defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters.

#### PROJECT INTRODUCTION

> Let's see how we can evolve the ASCII generator with our ZTM community help!! Maybe we want to display this on an HTML web page where users can submit images and we convert it to ASCII art? Maybe we want to improve how the Command Line Tool works/make it more customizeable? Or maybe modify the script to do many other types of art beyond ASCII.

The options are endless, and there is no wrong answer. This is all for fun, so try to customize the tool whichever way you think would be best, and let's see what we get at the end of the month! Enjoy!

# What happens after I make a pull request?

Simply speaking, your work is done. You can continue working and making pull requests on the same repo or work on something new.

Meanwhile, Hacktoberfest keeps track of all your pull requests. And, as mentioned above, you'll be eligible to get the Hacktoberfest digital reward once you successfully make 4 pull requests.

**Remember, you only need to make 4 pull requests to any of these open source projects in the month of October! Let's see if we can beat the record from last year!!**
